			<p>What to do 2022-12-28/P3D?</p>
		</header>

		<h2>What</h2>

		<p>If 37C3 should not happen in 2023, we aim for a hacking, art, congress replacement, politics gathering and party from December 28th to December 30th 2023 in Leipzig with 500 attendees or more</p>

		<p>This webseite will keep you up to date with whatever your winter holiday plans 2023 may be.</p>

		<h2>Why</h2>

		<p>In October 2022 it was finally announced that the Chaos Communication Congress 2022 will be cancelled for the third year in a row. For this period 2022 was called for decentralized events. In such a short term, it was not possible for hackers to plan events that total anything close to the 17.000 people that attended 36C3 in Messe Leipzig.</p>

		<p>If Chaos Communication Congress is cancelled yet another year in succession, we don't want to be at home again. After three years of disappointment, we finally want to meet our co-hackers irl again. Drink some Tschunk, have a workshop, hear a talk, have a party, chill in the lounge, collect some stickers, touch some electronics, see an installation, paint a banner, find new friends, find old friends and collect some bottles!</p>

		<h2>How</h2>

		<p>At this point, nothing is settled but we have a location with a capacity of 500 people, possibly more when using additional premises within the building. This not your glossy Leipzig fair, this is a dirty yet full-featured underground venue. It has bars, it has music, it has lights. Toilets, chairs, light installations, lovely staff and in-house geeks. It has an outdoor area. It has an angel space and other behind-the-scenes infrastructure.</p>

		<p>What it doesn't have is enough Sofas, enough Tables, showers, a sufficient kitchen and the rest it takes to feed all of us. It lacks workshop equipment, video streaming, DECT, enough internet, a sauna waggon, cocktail robots, ball baths and <b>you</b>.</p>

		<h2>Join in!</h2>

		<p>We are few individuals and we're in a very early stage of planning. We're looking for co-conspirators to finish up a concept, dissect tasks and find groups and individuals who take part in them.</p>
