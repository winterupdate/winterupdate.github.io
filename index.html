    <h1>Winterupdate</h1>
    <p>2023 Hackevent in Leipzig</p>
  </header>
  <h2>What</h2>
  <p>We're planning a hacking, art, 36C3 replacement (should it be cancelled again), politics gathering and party winter 2023 in Leipzig with 500 attendees or more</p>
  <p>This webseite will keep you up to date with whatever your winter holiday plans 2023 may be.</p>
  <h2>Why</h2>
  <p>In October 2022 it was finally announced that the Chaos Communication Congress 2022 will be cancelled for the third year in a row. For this period 2022 was called for decentralized events. In such a short term, it was not possible for hackers to plan events that total anything close to the 17.000 people that attended 36C3 in Messe Leipzig.</p>
  <p>If Chaos Communication Congress is cancelled yet another year in succession, we don't want to be at home again. After three years of disappointment, we finally want to meet our co-hackers irl again. Drink some Tschunk, have a workshop, hear a talk, have a party, chill in the lounge, collect some stickers, touch some electronics, see an installation, paint a banner, find new friends, find old friends and collect some bottles!</p>
  <p>Originally we aimed for this to happen during <em>congress time</em> but we'd rather be independent of whatever CCC may decide and are therefore now considering dates in mid-november.</p>
  <h2>How</h2>
  <p>At this point, nothing is settled but we have a location with a capacity of 500 people, possibly more when using additional premises within the building. This not your glossy Leipzig fair, this is a dirty yet full-featured underground venue. It has bars, it has music, it has lights. Toilets, chairs, light installations, lovely staff and in-house geeks. It has an outdoor area. It has an angel space and other behind-the-scenes infrastructure.</p>
  <p>What it doesn't have is enough sofas, enough tables, showers, a sufficient kitchen and the rest it takes to feed all of us. It lacks workshop equipment, video streaming, DECT, enough internet, a sauna waggon, cocktail robots, ball baths and <strong>you</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Join in!</h2>
  <p>We are few individuals and we're in a very early stage of planning. We're looking for co-conspirators to finish up a concept, dissect tasks and find groups and individuals who take part in them.</p>
